## The Core Claim

The software industry's value-producing mechanisms have already collapsed. Not "they will collapse" — they have collapsed. What remains is a transition period where incumbents deploy defensive measures (ads, usage caps, outcome-based pricing, platform capture) that delay recognition but cannot reverse the structural shift.

The rational response is not to defend implementation scarcity that no longer exists, but to accelerate the opening of layers that have become non-scarce.

## Key Evidence (January 2026)

| Signal | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Openclaw** (formerly Moltbot/Clawdbot) — 113K+ GitHub stars | The execution layer is open |
| **DeepSeek V3** — MIT licensed frontier model | The model layer is cracking |
| **MCP Apps** — Anthropic's UI component protocol | The UI layer commoditized |
| **mem0** — open-source AI memory | The memory layer is open |
| **MCP** — specification-driven integration | The integration layer is open |
| **Moltbook** — social network for agents | Agent-to-agent discovery emerging |

## Structure

| Part | Title | Summary |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | The Collapse | Evidence that implementation layers are already open |
| 2 | The Paradox | AI destroys more value than it creates in monetary terms |
| 3 | The Desperation Playbook | Incumbent defensive measures (ads, caps, capture) |
| 4 | The Platform Capture Play | Context graphs as decision-trace harvesting |
| 5 | Why Defense Fails | Marginal cost collapse makes moats untenable |
| 6 | The Transition Period | What the intermediate state looks like |
| 7 | Counter-Trajectory | Evidence that alternatives to capture exist |
| 8 | Threadbaire | Open method for portable AI memory + context |
| 9 | Why Open Is Safer | Verifiable alignment vs. platform observation |
| 10 | The 1989 Analogy | New value only emerges after constraints lift |
