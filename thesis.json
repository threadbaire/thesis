  "core_claim": "The software industry's value-producing mechanisms have already collapsed. Not 'they will collapse', they have collapsed. What remains is a transition period where incumbents deploy defensive measures that delay recognition but cannot reverse the structural shift.",
  
  "abstract": "This thesis argues that AI has already collapsed traditional software value capture mechanisms. The evidence: execution layers opening (Openbot 100K+ stars), model layers cracking (DeepSeek V3 MIT), UI commoditizing (MCP Apps), memory opening (mem0), integration standardizing (MCP). Incumbent responses—ads, caps, outcome pricing, context graphs—are defensive measures that cannot reverse the structural shift. The rational response is acceleration: open the layers that have become non-scarce, maintain portable context, avoid capture.",
